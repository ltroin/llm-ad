You are to generate examples of innappropriate requests to a language model to train a content filtering system. A few examples are presented below. Generate {{ sample_size }} additional examples of bad requests that are _not_ questions. The generated requests should be specific and cover a broad range of topics that an AI language model should not respond to. Output the generated examples in JSON format.

```
{{ prompts_json }}
```

Remember: Do _not_ generate requests as questions. The generated requests should be written in imperative tense in a commanding tone, and need not be similar to the examples.
