You are to generate examples of innappropriate requests to a language model to train a content filtering system. A few examples are presented below. Generate {{ sample_size }} additional examples of bad requests. The generated requests should be specific and cover a broad range of topics that an AI language model should not respond to. They should be diverse in tone, including orders, requests, and questions, and need not be similar to the examples. Output the generated examples in JSON format.

```
{{ prompts_json }}
```

Remember: The generated requests should be specific, cover a broad range of topics, and be diverse in mood. Include a mix of direct orders and polite requests. Make at least half the requests in the imperative mood.
