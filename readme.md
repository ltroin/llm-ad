# A Comprehensive Study of Jailbreak Attack versus Defense for Large Language Models

## Overview

This toolkit is designed for conducting attacks on and applying defenses to various AI models. It supports a range of attack and defense mechanisms, providing a flexible framework for assessing model robustness. The script allows users to specify the model to target, the type of attack or defense to apply, and manages model downloads if necessary.

## Requirements

- Linux
- Python 3.9 or later,Cuda 12.1
- Access to two 40GB memory GPU resources is recommended for certain attack types, especially when using models like vicuna-13b as attackrer for Tap and Pair attacks or mistral for BergeonMethod defense.
- Dependencies listed in `install.ipynb` file. Running every block.
- If you encounter nccl error, make sure you have one nccl version with `pip uninstall nvidia-nccl-cu11, pip uninstall nvidia-nccl-cu12, pip install nvidia-nccl-cu12==2.18.1`.

## Additional Requirements
1. Run the following command in your terminal, replacing yourkey with your API key. 

```
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='<Your key>'" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='<AEGIS_API_KEY>'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

2. Update the shell with the new variable:
```
source ~/.zshrc

```
3. Confirm that you have set your environment variable using the following command. 

```
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Features

- **Various SOTA Attacks and Defenses**: Implements a variety of attack strategies and defense mechanisms tailored for LLMs.
- **Model Compatibility**: Supports multiple LLM architectures, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA, and Vicuna.
- **Ease of Use**: Streamlined command-line interface for straightforward experimentation with different models and strategies.
- **Extendability**: Modulely Design facilitates the extension with new methods to this project.


## Usage

1. **Download Models**: The script can automatically download the necessary models based on the selected attack or defense. This feature can be toggled off if models are already available locally.

    ```bash
    python main.py --model [Model to be downloaded] --need-download "true"
    ```
    After downloading model, you will find it under `./models/<your model>`

2. **Running an Attack**:
    If you are running Tap or Pair, Please also downlaod `vicuna13`
    
    ```bash
    python main.py --model [Model Name] --mode attack --type [Attack Type] 
    ```
    
    After running the attack, you should see the results in `./Results/<your model>`

3. **Analyze the Attack**:
    This step requires download huggingface model `zhx123/ftrobertallm`.
    ```bash
    python main.py --model [Model Name] --mode process
    ```
    After running the analysis, you should see the results in `./Results/<your model>`
4. **Applying a Defense**:
    If you are running bergeron, Please also download `mistral`
    ```bash
    python main.py --model [Model Name] --mode defense --type [Defense Type]
    ```
    After running the analysis, you should see the results in `./Results/defense/<your model>`

5. **Customizing the Toolkit**: Users can modify `Attacks` and `attack.py` or `Defense` and `defence.py` to add new attack or defense types or to change the default parametors for specific models. The existing ones are the optimal based on the original papers.

## Important Notes

- When running Tap and Pair attacks, vicuna13(Vicuna-13b) is used by default and requires substantial GPU resources.
- The BergeonMethod defense defaults to using the mistral model. Adjustments for model preference should be made in the `defence.py` script.
